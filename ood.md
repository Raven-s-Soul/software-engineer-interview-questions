### Questions

* What is abstraction? What are the differences between abstraction, encapsulation, and information hiding?
* What is Coupling? How does abstraction affect coupling?
* What is Cohesion? Is this value the reciprocal of Coupling?
* Separation of concerns
    - What it is?
    - What are the benefits of following this principle?
    - What do horizontal and vertical separation of concerns mean?
    - Is vertical separation possible without horizontal and vice versa?
    - How is it associated with the Single Responsibility Principle and with cohesion?
* Simplicity
    - What is the KISS principle?
    - How does KISS help in building mental models? What is the value of these models?
    - How can participating in the development of business requirements help follow KISS?
    - When is abstraction contrary to KISS?
    - Why inheritance can lead to violation of KISS?
    - What is the principle of YAGNI? How does it compare with the KISS principle?
* DRY
    - How is the principle related to Cohesion?
    - How is the principle related to the principle of SRP?
    - Why is this principle inextricably linked with SPOT (Single point of truth)?
    - What are some examples of code duplication that do not violate DRY?
    - What are some examples of copying business logic code that also do not violate DRY?
    - How can following the DRY principle lead to a violation of KISS?
    - How can following the DRY principle lead to Premature Generalization?
    - Why, when trying to remove duplication, when there are still few repetitions of this code (up to 4-5), we can easily make a mistake and choose the wrong refactoring method? What is the analogy with statistics?
    - How do you explain the phrase "Duplication is far cheaper than the wrong abstraction."?
* What are Cross-cutting concerns? What does coarse-grained and fine-grained responsibility mean?
