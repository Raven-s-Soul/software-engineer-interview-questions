# Patterns 

### Questions

* What is the difference between structural, generative, and behavioral types of patterns?
* For each pattern, answer the questions:
    - What is the essence of the pattern?
    - What problems can be solved with the help of this pattern?
    - What are his shortcomings?
    - What are some examples of the use of this pattern?
    - What kind of pattern is this and why?
* Singleton
* Strategy
* Template method
* Factory, Factory Method, Abstract Factory
* Observer / mediator
* Facade
* Decorator
* Dependency injection
* Command
* Component
* What examples of the implementation of these patterns can be given in a functional language, or in a language where functions are objects of the first class, have closures, and do not have built-in implementation tools to express the classical OO approach?
